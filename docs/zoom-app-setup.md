# Zoom Integration Setup Guide

Use this guide to configure Zoom for the Vexa meeting bot in self-hosted or custom deployments.

## Overview

Vexa joins Zoom meetings with the Zoom Meeting SDK, captures audio, and sends it through the transcription pipeline.

```text
Zoom Meeting SDK -> PCM audio -> WhisperLive -> transcript output
```

Zoom requires an authorized token path (OBF/ZAK/RTMS) for Meeting SDK apps joining meetings outside their own account starting **March 2, 2026**.

## Important Caveats (Approval + Who You Can Join)

### Marketplace approval takes time

If you want your Zoom app to join meetings across other users/accounts, you generally need to submit it for Zoom Marketplace review and approval. This process can take weeks to months.

### Before approval: expect "your meetings only"

Before your Zoom app is approved (and depending on Zoom policy and account settings), you should assume you can reliably join only meetings created/hosted by you personally (the account that owns/authorizes the app). Use this for development and internal testing.

### Hosted service status

The hosted Vexa service Zoom app is **not approved** at the time of writing, so Zoom bots from the hosted service should be treated as limited to the authorizing user's own meetings until approval is complete.

## 1. Create and Configure the Zoom App

1. Open [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).
2. Click `Develop` -> `Build App`.
3. Select `General App`.
4. Select management model:
   - `User-managed` (recommended): each user authorizes their own Zoom account.
   - `Admin-managed`: account admin authorizes for users in their org.
5. In `Features` -> `Embed`, enable `Meeting SDK`.
6. In `Features` -> `Surface`, enable only products you use:
   - `Meetings` (required for standard bot usage)
   - `Webinars` (optional, only if you support webinar joins)
   - Leave unrelated in-client surfaces disabled unless you actually use them.

Suggested metadata:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| App name | `Vexa Meeting Bot` |
| Short description | `Real-time meeting transcription` |
| Company | `Your Organization` |
| Developer contact | `maintainer@your-domain.com` |

## 2. OAuth Configuration

Set redirect URL(s) to where your dashboard serves Zoom callback UI:

- Production example: `https://dashboard.your-domain.com/auth/zoom/callback`
- Local dashboard dev: `http://localhost:3001/auth/zoom/callback`

Redirect URL must match exactly (scheme, host, path, trailing slash behavior).

If you override callback via env, it must exactly match your Zoom app redirect URL:

- `ZOOM_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`

Set deauthorization notification URL (required for distribution/review):

- `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/zoom/deauthorize`

Note: this repository currently does not include a Zoom deauthorization webhook handler. Implement it before marketplace submission.

## 3. Scopes (Exact Matrix)

Scopes are configured in the Zoom app itself. The current dashboard OAuth start route does not append a `scope` query parameter and relies on the app-configured scopes.

| Scope | Required | Used by current code | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user:read:token` | Yes for external Zoom meetings | Yes | Required to mint OBF via `GET /v2/users/me/token?type=onbehalf...` |
| `user:read:zak` | No | No | Only needed if you implement a ZAK-based join path (not used in current Vexa flow) |

If you only run same-account/internal testing with SDK credentials, OAuth scopes are not needed for that path.
No additional Zoom scopes are required by the current Vexa Zoom integration.

## 4. Environment Variables

Backend/bot runtime:

```bash
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_zoom_client_id
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoom_client_secret
```

Dashboard OAuth (recommended explicit settings):

```bash
ZOOM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_zoom_client_id
ZOOM_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoom_client_secret
ZOOM_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://dashboard.your-domain.com/auth/zoom/callback
ZOOM_OAUTH_STATE_SECRET=long_random_secret
```

Implementation detail:

- Dashboard and bot-manager resolve OAuth credentials with fallback:
  `ZOOM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` -> `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`.
- Dashboard state signing secret fallback is:
  `ZOOM_OAUTH_STATE_SECRET` -> `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` -> `VEXA_ADMIN_API_KEY`.

## 5. OBF Flow in This Codebase

Current behavior when creating a Zoom bot:

1. If request includes `zoom_obf_token`, backend uses it directly.
2. Otherwise backend reads stored user Zoom OAuth tokens.
3. If access token is expired, backend refreshes it via `POST https://zoom.us/oauth/token`.
4. Backend mints OBF via:
   `GET https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me/token?type=onbehalf&meeting_id={MEETING_ID}`.
5. Bot passes OBF to SDK join as `onBehalfToken`.

## 6. Quick Verification

Internal/same-account check:

```bash
ZOOM_MEETING_URL="https://us05web.zoom.us/j/YOUR_MEETING_ID?pwd=YOUR_PASSWORD" \
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="$ZOOM_CLIENT_ID" \
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="$ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET" \
./services/vexa-bot/run-zoom-bot.sh
```

External meeting check:

1. User completes Zoom OAuth in dashboard.
2. User starts Zoom bot without manual `zoom_obf_token`.
3. Bot-manager mints OBF and bot joins.
4. Bot remains valid only while the authorizing user is present.

## 7. Security Rules

- Never commit Zoom client secrets, access tokens, refresh tokens, or OBF tokens.
- Never commit raw portal exports/snapshots containing account or credential data.
- If any credential is exposed, rotate it in Zoom immediately.
