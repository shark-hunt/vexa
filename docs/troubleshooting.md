# Troubleshooting

This page covers the most common production and self-hosted issues.

## Bot issues

### Bot joins then leaves quickly

Common causes:

- not admitted (Google Meet waiting room)
- wrong meeting ID / passcode (Teams)
- Zoom not configured (missing OAuth/OBF token path or Meeting SDK credentials)
- meeting ended / link invalid

What to do:

1. Check meeting status history in your UI (or your logs).
2. Confirm you used the correct `native_meeting_id` for the platform.
3. For Meet/Teams: confirm a host admits the bot.
4. For Zoom: confirm [`zoom-app-setup.md`](zoom-app-setup.md) is fully configured.

## Transcript issues

### No transcript segments

Common causes:

- `transcribe_enabled=false`
- there was no speech (silence)
- audio capture failed (platform/browser restrictions)

Verify:

- call `GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` and check `segments`
- check bot logs for capture/transcription errors

## Recording / playback issues

### "No audio recording" (post-meeting)

Common causes:

- `recording_enabled=false` for that meeting
- storage backend misconfigured (object store credentials/bucket)
- recording is still finalizing (short delay after stop)

What to do:

1. Call `GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` and check if `recordings` exists.
2. If recordings exist, stream audio via:
   - `GET /recordings/{recording_id}/media/{media_file_id}/raw`
3. Validate storage configuration:
   - [`recording-storage.md`](recording-storage.md)

### Browser playback can't seek

Seeking requires `Range` support (`206 Partial Content`).

If you proxy audio through a frontend, ensure your proxy forwards the `Range` header and returns the raw bytes without JSON parsing.

## Delete / retention issues

### Deleted meetings still appear

Vexa anonymizes deleted meetings for telemetry/usage tracking. UIs should hide deleted meetings from default lists.
