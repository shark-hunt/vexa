# Voice Agent

The Voice Agent feature transforms the Vexa bot from a passive transcription observer into a fully interactive meeting participant. An external agent or application controls the bot via REST API to speak, read/write chat, and share visual content during a live meeting.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Speak** | Text-to-speech or raw audio playback into the meeting | Working |
| **Chat write** | Send messages to the meeting chat | Working |
| **Chat read** | Capture messages from the meeting chat | Working |
| **Screen share** | Display images, URLs, or video via screen share | Working |
| **Virtual camera** | Show avatar/content via the bot's camera feed | Experimental |

## Quick Start

### 1. Request a voice-agent-enabled bot

Add `voice_agent_enabled: true` to your `POST /bots` request:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "google_meet",
    "native_meeting_id": "abc-defg-hij",
    "bot_name": "AI Assistant",
    "voice_agent_enabled": true
  }'
```

### 2. Make the bot speak

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/speak" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello everyone, I am the meeting assistant.", "voice": "nova"}'
```

### 3. Send a chat message

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"text": "Meeting summary: 3 action items identified."}'
```

### 4. Share visual content

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/screen" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"type": "image", "url": "https://example.com/quarterly-chart.png"}'
```

For the full endpoint reference, see [Voice Agent API](api/voice-agent.md).

## How It Works

When `voice_agent_enabled` is set, the bot's audio pipeline changes: instead of feeding silence as mic input, the bot reads from a PulseAudio virtual microphone that receives TTS audio. The bot starts muted and auto-unmutes only when speaking.

### Audio Pipeline (TTS)

```
OpenAI TTS API
  -> PCM stream (24 kHz, mono)
  -> PulseAudio virtual sink
  -> Chromium default audio source
  -> WebRTC -> meeting participants hear speech
```

The bot unmutes before playback and re-mutes once audio finishes or is interrupted.

### Screen Content Pipeline

```
API request (image/url/video)
  -> Playwright renders content on Xvfb (1920x1080)
  -> Content displayed fullscreen
  -> Bot clicks "Present now" in meeting UI
  -> Participants see shared screen with content
```

### Chat Pipeline

The bot interacts with the meeting's native chat UI via DOM automation:
- **Write**: opens the chat panel, types the message, and sends it
- **Read**: captures messages from the chat panel (sender, text, timestamp)

## Chat Read & Write

Chat enables two-way text communication in the meeting alongside voice.

**Write a message:**
```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"text": "Here is the meeting summary so far."}'
```

**Read all messages:**
```bash
curl "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/chat" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"
```

Returns an array of messages with `sender`, `text`, `timestamp`, and `isFromBot` fields. Real-time chat events are also available via [WebSocket](websocket.md) (`chat.received`, `chat.sent`).

## Screen Share (Showing Images & Content)

Display visual content to meeting participants via the bot's screen share. Three content types are supported:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `image` | Renders an image fullscreen on a black background |
| `url` | Opens a URL in a browser window (e.g., Google Slides, dashboards) |
| `video` | Plays video fullscreen with autoplay |

```bash
# Share an image
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/screen" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"type": "image", "url": "https://example.com/chart.png"}'

# Share a Google Slides presentation
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/screen" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"type": "url", "url": "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/..."}'

# Stop sharing
curl -X DELETE "$API_BASE/bots/google_meet/abc-defg-hij/screen" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY"
```

## Avatar (Virtual Camera)

> **Warning**: The virtual camera feature is **experimental**. It works intermittently on Google Meet due to WebRTC `replaceTrack` reliability. For displaying visual content to participants, **screen share is recommended** as the more reliable approach.

The virtual camera uses a canvas-based approach to replace the bot's camera feed with custom content (e.g., an avatar image or animation). When working, participants see the avatar in the bot's video tile instead of a blank camera.

Current limitations:
- Only tested on Google Meet
- `replaceTrack` into WebRTC works intermittently
- No configuration API yet (avatar is set at bot startup)
- Screen share is the recommended alternative for displaying images and content

## WebSocket Events

When voice agent is enabled, additional events are published on the [WebSocket](websocket.md) connection:

| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `speak.started` | `{"text": "..."}` | Bot started speaking |
| `speak.completed` | -- | Speech playback finished |
| `speak.interrupted` | -- | Speech was interrupted via API |
| `chat.received` | `{"sender": "John", "text": "...", "timestamp": 1234}` | Chat message captured from a participant |
| `chat.sent` | `{"text": "..."}` | Bot sent a chat message |
| `screen.sharing_started` | `{"content_type": "image"}` | Screen sharing started |
| `screen.sharing_stopped` | -- | Screen sharing stopped |

## Platform Support

| Feature | Google Meet | Teams | Zoom |
|---------|:----------:|:-----:|:----:|
| Speak (TTS) | Supported | Planned | Planned |
| Chat write | Supported | Planned | Planned |
| Chat read | Supported | Planned | Planned |
| Screen share | Supported | Planned | Planned |
| Virtual camera | Experimental | -- | -- |

## Prerequisites

- **OPENAI_API_KEY** (required for TTS): OpenAI API key for text-to-speech synthesis. Passed through `docker-compose.yml` to the bot container.
- **PulseAudio**: Already configured in the bot container (`entrypoint.sh`). No manual setup needed.

## Known Limitations

1. **Virtual camera is experimental** -- the canvas-based virtual camera works intermittently on Google Meet. Screen share is more reliable for displaying visual content.
2. **Single TTS provider** -- currently only OpenAI TTS is implemented. The architecture supports adding other providers.
3. **Google Meet only** -- chat read/write and screen share are currently implemented for Google Meet. Teams and Zoom support is planned.
4. **No speech queue** -- rapid speak commands may overlap. Wait for the `speak.completed` WebSocket event before sending the next command, or use `DELETE /speak` to interrupt.
